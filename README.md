# searchingOperationsInListPython
This program implements linear search and binary search in Python.

A list is generated by N randomly generated numbers. The search operations are performed on the list.
The list is sorted first before applying the searching algoithms.

The binary search algorithm is implemeneted by both iterative and recursion approaches.
The time required by different searching approaches have been calculated.
